From March 2016 to September 2019, I worked as a **Software Engineer** at **CodeTaiwan**, an EdTech startup based in Taipei. Our mission was to develop and deploy a custom Learning Management System (LMS) used directly by private schools to deliver their curriculum.

Working in a lean startup environment meant embracing versatility and taking ownership across various technical domains – truly a role where I wore multiple hats. This period was crucial for refining my core technical skills across the full stack and infrastructure.

**Key Contributions & Responsibilities:**

*   **LMS Feature Development & Automation:** I **created automated reporting tools** directly within our newly developed LMS. This significantly streamlined data collection for educators and administrators, **reducing manual report generation time from roughly four hours per week down to just one hour**.
*   **Platform Architecture:** I **architected and defined the core logic for an integrated ad-serving platform** within the LMS. My design focused on scalability and performance, enabling an **80% increase in user scalability** and achieving a **20% improvement in page load speed**, which directly enhanced user experience and engagement.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure & Backend Administration:** I was responsible for **administering and scaling our Linux-based backend servers**. This involved leveraging both **AWS (EC2, S3)** and **Google Cloud (GCP)** services, utilizing containerization with **Docker** and orchestration with **Kubernetes** to ensure optimized server performance, reliability, and efficient resource utilization.
*   **Agile Process Facilitation:** I actively **facilitated regular progress check-ins** with cross-functional partners (like curriculum designers and educators). This promoted transparency throughout development cycles and created faster feedback loops, translating directly into actionable tasks and yielding **30% more efficient iteration periods** per sprint cycle.

**Technical Growth in a Startup Environment:**

This role was instrumental in my technical development. The need to contribute across the board meant rapidly learning and applying a wide range of technologies. My skillset expanded significantly during this time, encompassing frontend development (**JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, various CSS frameworks**), backend development (**Node.js, Express**), databases (**SQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB**), core computer science concepts (**Data Structures & Algorithms**), testing (**Jest, Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Puppeteer, Playwright**), and modern DevOps practices (**Git, Linux, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes**).

**Conclusion & Company Evolution:**

CodeTaiwan was a dynamic and challenging environment that provided invaluable hands-on experience, significantly shaping my technical foundation. While the original LMS venture faced headwinds and ultimately dissolved post-COVID, with the initial owners parting ways, the entrepreneurial spirit didn't completely disappear. Interestingly, a part of the business successfully pivoted, spinning off into a unique English after-school program where children learn the language alongside the strategy of the Pokémon Trading Card Game – a venture that is apparently thriving today! For me, the core takeaway remains the immense value of the foundational technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and adaptability gained during those formative startup years. It solidified my passion for building robust software solutions and navigating the ever-evolving tech landscape.
