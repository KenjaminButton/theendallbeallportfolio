From February 2017 to January 2019, I worked as a **Software Engineer** at **CodeTaiwan**, an EdTech startup in Taipei building a custom Learning Management System for private schools.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Automation & Tooling:** Built automated reporting tools that cut manual report generation from four hours per week to one hour.
* **Platform Architecture:** Designed and implemented an integrated ad-serving platform, enabling 80% increase in user scalability and 20% improvement in page load speed.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Managed Linux-based backend servers on AWS (EC2, S3) and Google Cloud, using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
* **CICD Pipelines:** Built and maintained deployment pipelines for reliable, repeatable releases.
* **Agile Development:** Facilitated sprint cycles with cross-functional teams, improving iteration efficiency by 30%.

**Technical Stack:**

Frontend (JavaScript, TypeScript, React), Backend (Python, Node.js, Express), Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL), Cloud (AWS, GCP), DevOps (Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Linux, CICD), Testing (Jest, Mocha, Puppeteer).

**Outcome:**

The original LMS venture dissolved post-COVID, but a spin-off pivoted into a successful English after-school program. The experience shaped my foundation in full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and building products from scratch in a fast-moving startup environment.
