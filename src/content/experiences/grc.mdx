From 2019 to 2022, I worked as a **Project Specialist and Software Engineer** at [**General Resources Company (GRC)**](https://www.generalresources.com/), a prominent professional engineering services firm headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. GRC specializes in the demanding railway industry across Asia, offering comprehensive services spanning Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Testing, and Consulting (EPC+). My time there involved supporting major infrastructure projects, including work related to the Taipei MRT system and the significant Hong Kong to Shenzhen railway line initiative.

My role was a unique hybrid, leveraging my technical skills within the complex environment of large-scale construction and engineering projects. While based primarily in the main office in Neihu, Taipei, solving technical challenges and developing software, I also engaged in fieldwork when necessary to support on-site operations.

**Key Contributions & Responsibilities:**

*   **Software Development for Bidding:** I engineered and implemented critical software solutions tailored for managing and streamlining bid submissions for construction projects. This directly supported the management of over 150 active contracts, optimizing essential pre-project workflows.
*   **Process Automation:** A key focus was automating the bidding processes. This initiative yielded a **30% increase in efficiency and accuracy**, enhancing GRC's competitiveness and the success rate of project bids within the construction management lifecycle.
*   **Technical Specifications & Compliance:** I established detailed technical specifications for the bid automation software, which played a crucial role in significantly **reducing submission errors** and ensuring adherence to rigorous industry standards.
*   **Improving Project Collaboration:** I drove the adoption and utilization of project management tools like **Jira and Confluence** within GRC's construction teams. This fostered greater transparency and communication, resulting in an **18% acceleration in project completion timelines**.
*   **Fieldwork & Data Integration:** My responsibilities included conducting fieldwork to gather critical project data. This hands-on approach empowered on-site teams with actionable information, contributing to a **25% increase in meeting project deadlines** â€“ vital for achieving construction milestones effectively.
*   **Technical Problem-Solving:** Given the international nature of the projects and associated language barriers, my role heavily emphasized technical contributions. I tackled numerous coding projects and resolved complex computer-related issues, providing essential support across various project facets.

My journey with GRC concluded following the company's merger with MitAc. Coupled with the global shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to relocate to the Bay Area, California. This experience at GRC was invaluable, providing deep insights into the Asian railway sector, the intricacies of large-scale international engineering projects, and the impactful application of software engineering and automation in a specialized industrial domain.
