From 2019 to 2022, I worked as a **Project Specialist and Software Engineer** at [**General Resources Company (GRC)**](https://www.generalresources.com/), a professional engineering services firm in Taipei specializing in railway infrastructure across Asia. I supported major projects including the Taipei MRT system and the Hong Kong to Shenzhen railway line.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Bidding Automation:** Built software tools that streamlined bid submissions across 150+ active contracts, improving efficiency and accuracy by 30%.
* **Technical Specifications:** Defined specs for bid automation software, reducing submission errors and ensuring compliance with industry standards.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Managed cloud resources on AWS and Google Cloud, supporting project data systems and internal tools.
* **Project Management Tools:** Drove adoption of Jira, Confluence, and Asana across engineering teams, accelerating project completion timelines by 18%.
* **Fieldwork & Data Integration:** Conducted site visits to gather project data and coordinate with on-site teams, contributing to a 25% increase in meeting project deadlines.
* **Capacity Planning:** Forecasted labor, materials, and subcontractor requirements for construction bids across 150+ contracts.

**Technical Stack:**

Python, JavaScript, SQL, AWS, GCP, Docker, Git, Linux, Jira, Confluence, Asana.

**Outcome:**

GRC merged with MitAc during the pandemic. I relocated to the Bay Area, taking with me deep experience in automation, infrastructure projects, and applying software engineering to solve real-world operational problems at scale.
