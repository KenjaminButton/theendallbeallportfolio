Ready for a quick brain teaser? I built this [**Quizzical Clone**](https://quizzical-darwin-b008a9.netlify.app/), a fun trivia game application inspired by the popular format. It's designed to test your general knowledge with questions pulled directly from a live database.

This frontend application is built entirely with **React**. It leverages the power of functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage the game's state, such as fetching questions, tracking user answers, and calculating the final score. For fetching the trivia questions, it uses **Axios** to interact with the [**Open Trivia Database (opentdb.com) API**](https://opentdb.com/).

Key aspects of building this project included:

*   **API Integration:** Making asynchronous requests to fetch trivia questions using Axios and handling the response data.
*   **State Management:** Using React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage the lifecycle of the quiz â€“ from loading questions to displaying results.
*   **UI Development:** Creating an interactive and responsive user interface in React to display questions and options, and provide feedback on answers.
*   **Data Handling:** Processing the API data, including decoding HTML entities sometimes present in the questions/answers.
*   **Deployment:** Configuring and deploying the React application using Netlify.

This project was a fantastic way to solidify core React concepts and practice working with external APIs.

Feel free to test your knowledge with the [**live demo**](https://quizzical-darwin-b008a9.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify, or explore the codebase on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/KenjaminButton/flashcards2) to see how the React components interact and manage the quiz flow.
