Feeling like you need a quick pick-me-up or a guaranteed (cringe-worthy?) laugh? Check out this simple [**Dad Jokes Generator**](https://dad-jokes-navy.vercel.app/)! It's a straightforward web app designed purely for fun – fetching and displaying classic dad jokes to hopefully brighten your day, one groan at a time.

Beyond the chuckles, this project was also an exercise in creating clean, understandable code using just the basics: **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It connects to the awesome [icanhazdadjoke API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) to pull in a fresh joke with a simple click. The goal was to keep the implementation clear and accessible, demonstrating how much you can achieve with fundamental web technologies without relying on heavy frameworks.

It's a perfect little example of fetching data asynchronously and updating the DOM – core concepts made easy to grasp.

Feel free to explore the code yourself over on the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/KenjaminButton/dad-jokes). Give the [live app](https://dad-jokes-navy.vercel.app/) a try, have a laugh, and maybe even peek under the hood!
