Ever wanted a focused way to catch up on the latest from the `/r/WebDev` community without the distractions of the full Reddit site? I built this simple [**Reddit Client**](https://kendersons-reddit-client.netlify.app/) to do just that! It serves as a clean interface to browse recent posts from one of my favorite subreddits.

This frontend application uses **React** to build the user interface and **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management. It fetches data directly from the Reddit JSON API, specifically targeting the `/r/WebDev` subreddit, and renders the posts in a straightforward list.

Building this was a great practical exercise in:

*   Fetching and handling data from a third-party API.
*   Managing application state effectively using Redux Toolkit slices and actions.
*   Structuring a React application with components.
*   Deploying a React application (hosted on Netlify).

You can check out the [live version](https://kendersons-reddit-client.netlify.app/) hosted on Netlify or dive into the source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/KenjaminButton/reddit-client) to see how it's put together using React, Redux Toolkit, and standard web technologies.
